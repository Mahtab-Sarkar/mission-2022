            <p class="text-style-pragraph">A new year means a new light, new hope to dream come true. In 2022 I want to see as a person whom I always dream about. Instead of trying to focus on too many goals, narrow it down to 1-3 major goals that I hope to achieve within the year. This ensures that I won't lose my motivation.</p>

                <p class="text-style-pragraph-1">As the first step to developing your vision, it may be worth writing down how success will look. Define as many aspects of it as possible for you, but also identify the one most important aspect (money, fame, family etc).</p>
